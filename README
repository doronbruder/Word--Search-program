Explanation for the sub functions:
The  division into different functions in the "finds words in matrix":
My idea was to split it into two main functions :
The first "search current direction" will be
 responsible for go over  each direction 
That was chosen by the user   together 
 with every possible point in the matrix
And call the next function " search from some
 point " that for each direction and each
 point is  checks all possible words in the chosen direction 
that start at the current point or after the 
current point but in the same direction- when the 
limit is the length and width of the matrix
 for each possible word in a chosen direction
 it checks if the word is in the list 
If it is is updated a dictionary I built
 that Link found words and their count

The function I decided to check:
‪"‬update_coordinates"
This function is reponssible for
 changing the coordinates according the chosen
 direction
for example 'u'=up=(-1,0) so x should updates with -1 and y should not change
The checks I made to test that function are :
1.checks all the ordinary cases where the 
direction is valid - make sure the coordinates updated properly
2‪. checks an extreme case that the direction
 is invalid and makes sure it doesnt change the coordination in that case‬
